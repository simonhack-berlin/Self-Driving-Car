# Self-Driving-Car
During my self-study of <b>TypeScript</b>, I've been trying to put what I've learned into practice with this little exercise. <br>
Designed using my knowledge of TypeScript object types, applying them to a variety of classes, properties, and methods.<br>
The idea is simple: create a vehicle that can see the world and react to it as a human driver would, but the implementation is full of obstacles. So I created a program that allows a car to react to obstacles on the road.
