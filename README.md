# Self-Driving-Car
after my self-study of ## TypeScript here is my first project designed using my knowledge of TypeScript object types to apply types to a variety of classes, properties and methods.
The idea is simple: create a vehicle that can see the world and react to it as a human driver would, but the implementation is full of obstacles. So I created a program that allows a car to react to obstacles on the road.
